- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript architecture
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Procedural texture generation for backgrounds

### Physics System
```javascript
// Enhanced physics materials for realistic interactions
const ballMaterial = new CANNON.Material('ball');
const pinMaterial = new CANNON.Material('pin');
const groundMaterial = new CANNON.Material('ground');

// Contact materials with realistic friction and restitution
const ballPinContact = new CANNON.ContactMaterial(ballMaterial, pinMaterial, {
  friction: 0.1,
  restitution: 0.4
});
```

### Multi-Lane Architecture
```javascript
// Lane state management system
let laneStates = new Map(); // Stores game state for each lane
let decorativePinsByLane = new Map(); // Manages decorative pins
let currentPhysicsLane = 3; // Tracks active physics lane

// Lane switching with state persistence
function switchToLane(newLaneNumber) {
  saveCurrentLaneState();
  cleanupLanePhysics();
  switchPhysicsPinsToLane(newLaneNumber);
  loadLaneState(newLaneNumber);
}
```

### Camera System
```javascript
// Smooth ball tracking with interpolation
if (ball && ball.thrown && gameState === 'ROLLING') {
  const lerpFactor = 0.1;
  camera.position.x += (targetX - camera.position.x) * lerpFactor;
  camera.position.z += (targetZ - camera.position.z) * lerpFactor;
  camera.lookAt(ballPos.x, 1, ballPos.z + 3);
}
```

## üé≥ Game Rules & Scoring

### Bowling Fundamentals
- **10 Frames per Game**: Standard bowling game structure
- **Strike**: All 10 pins knocked down with first ball (Frame score + next 2 rolls)
- **Spare**: All 10 pins knocked down with two balls (Frame score + next 1 roll)
- **10th Frame Special Rules**: Extra rolls for strikes/spares in final frame
- **Gutter Balls**: Automatic 0 score when ball enters gutter without hitting pins

### Scoring System
```javascript
function calculateFrameScores(frames) {
  // Simplified scoring - sums pins knocked in each frame
  const scores = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const frame = frames[i];
    const frameScore = frame.rolls.reduce((sum, roll) => sum + roll, 0);
    scores.push(frameScore);
  }
  return scores;
}
```

## üéÆ Controls & Gameplay

### Mouse Controls
- **Mouse Movement**: Aim the ball left and right
- **Mouse Hold**: Charge power (oscillating power bar)
- **Mouse Release**: Throw ball with current power and aim

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **1-5**: Switch to lane number (if switching allowed)
- **R**: Emergency reset ball position
- **S**: Skip current roll (for testing)
- **F**: Full game reset
- **G**: Display position debug information

### Lane Switching Rules
- **Allowed**: Only on Roll 1 of any frame when game state is 'READY'
- **Blocked**: During active gameplay, power charging, or waiting for settlement
- **Visual Feedback**: Switch Lane button changes color based on availability
